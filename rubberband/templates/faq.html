<h4>How do I interpret the comparison view?</h4>
<p>
The compare view shows the same data as the Result Summary view, but for multiple test runs. The color of the cell represents how large the spread of values is ((largest-smallest)/base) for that particular instance and metric. The value in the tooltip represents the mean of all values. Each cell in the result summary also links to a chart, with all of the values plotted on a scatterplot.

<h4>When I click on <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>, it throws a 500.</h4>
<p>
The following two things happen when a file is uploaded:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/GregorCH/ipet">ipet</a> parses the input</li>
  <li>Rubberband stores that parsed data in elasticsearch</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the first part fails, then the entire operation is aborted. If the first part succeeds however, and the second part fails, the operation from the first part is not rolled back. This results in a situation where you can see the parsed results, but the raw log files are not available.
Either way, a quick look at the application log (instuser@rubberband.zib.de:/var/log/supervisor/rubberband-stderr---supervisor-*.log) could help debug these kinds of problems.</p>
